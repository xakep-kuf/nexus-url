## About Nexus Market
Nexus is a word that means a connection, link, core or centre. It seems that the team behind Nexus Market is aiming to provide all of these things by bringing together buyers and vendors into one place and becoming a major hub of the darknet. With the recent closures of Tor2Door, Royal Market and M00nkey Market, the launch of the darknet market is set to be a significant event. It will be interesting to see how it fares in the wake of these closures. How does it compare to its predecessors and current rivals? Letâ€™s take a closer look.

### Registration / Login process:

If you're new to the site, the first thing you need to do is create an account. It's really quick and easy, and you just need to provide a username, PIN (at least 6 digits) and a password. You don't need to provide any personal details, like your email address, as per the Darknet standard.
Next, you'll get a mnemonic code in case you ever forget your password. Just make sure you copy and save the mnemonic, because that's the only way you can restore your account. Once you've done that, you can log in with your new account.
